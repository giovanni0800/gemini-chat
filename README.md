<h1 align="center">Chat with Gemini AI</h1>

## üìñÔ∏è About
<p>I participated in immersions in deep journeys, where on the one hand I had approaches related to generative AI with Alura and Google, using Gemini and Google AI Studio with great protagonism to introduce tips and good practices in prompt engineering, so that we can extract the maximum of the tools it has so much to offer and even more to evolve over time.

On the other hand, I had the help of Hashtag Trainings, where I delved deeper into different Python concepts and tools, both for data analysis and an introduction to artificial intelligence along with Machine Learning with supervised learning.

I took advantage of the great direction of these people and decided to mix some themes and ideas covered in both journeys to test my learning and play a little with technologies.

I created a conversation chat where you can chat with logged in users at the same time as you can interact with Gemini, being able to process images or csv files with AI.

It is possible to observe that Gemini is not the best tool for working with mathematical calculations, something already expected from a generative AI, but imagine the future integrations, improvements and new features that may come over time!
